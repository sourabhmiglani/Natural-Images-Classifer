 it is an Image Classifier .In this Project We have made a hybrid Image Classifier by merging Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machines.To merge CNN and SVM We have sent last 2nd layer output of the CNN training as an input to SVM model.We were able to get an increment of 3 Percent increase in accuracy over Simple CNN Model.
