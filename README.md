Developed a hybrid image classifier by combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The output of the second last layer of the CNN training was used as input to the SVM model. This integration resulted in a 3% increase in accuracy compared to a simple CNN model.
